# Preparation

Welcome, this documentation describes the engineering related processes for adding
a new infrastructure provider to the OpenShift Container Platform. If you are
reading this, then you are most likely either planning to create a new provider
or are in the process of implementing your provider for OpenShift. This documentation
is intended to address the engineering-specific issues related to the process, if
you have questions about other aspects of this process (e.g. legal, marketing, etc.)
then you should reach out to your Red Hat representatives with those questions.

## Starting the process

To begin, read through this documentation making note of the various components
that will need to be configured for OpenShift. You will need to assess how your
infrastructure meets the various requirements of OpenShift, and identify where
gaps in feature coverage might exist.

If you are creating an infrastructure provider that will be included with
OpenShift Container Platform then you should already have a representative
from Red Hat who will be your primary contact for questions and help with this
process. If you have not contacted Red Het yet, please reach out through
this [Red Hat Partner Connect](https://connect.redhat.com/en/partner-with-us/red-hat-openshift-certification)
page for more information.
